# NESemu
An attempt to create a highly accurate NES emulator. There are indeed many around already but it seems fun so I decided to make one! 

Update:- Implemented CPU, and it passed through all the tests of nestest. Code is messy as of now, as I made lot of changes on the way as I code (I am novice :> ), but I will try to make it more readable and understandable soon!!!
